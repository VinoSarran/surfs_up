# “I scream. You scream.  We all scream for Beach Cream”

## Overview of Project:
This analysis helps examine the risk of opening a business that needs to function year round, year after year. What better way to gain insight than looking at the extremes: Mid Summer-June and Mid Winter-December for every year within the data.   

### Results: 
- Using 1700 observations, we see that June temperatures average 74.9 degrees.  It never drops below 64 degrees and it never exceeds 85 degrees:

- 50% of all June observations show a range of 73 to 77 degrees.    While December can get into the 50s, 50% of all observations show a range of 69 to 74 degrees.  Based on these findings, these months are very similiar and (barring a few chillier December days), beach goers should be around all year and in the mood for ice cream and surfing.  

  
  
  
 
### Summary:
- 72,458 roles will need to be filled as a result of the "silver tsunami"
- Even with minimal participation, there should be more than enough retirement-ready employees to train the 1,549 mentorship-eligible employees.  These 2 tables show tremendous overlap in titles between the 2 populations.

- Finally, not all retirement ready employees should be considered mentors.  There is a population of 5,315 soon to be retired employees who started with the company much later in their careers and have low tenure.  DOB 1955 but started  at 40+ years of age after 1996.  While they may have skills to share, there are 1,422 mentees that would have been at Pewlette Hackard for longer:
